These are my Data Science Projects:

March_Logit - Logistic Regession algorithm applied on March Madness data in hopes of determining if seeding has an impact on the outcome of games. Observing seeding and/or difference in seeds, did not show an impact on a win or loss for March Madness games

March_Analysis - EDA conducted on March Madness data. The trend of three pointers in college basketball has increased over time

BaltimoreAssualts.R - A dataset with the variables; time, date, crime, sex, gender, and location are explored with Apriori Rule Mining. High frequency combinations of variables with Assulat were observed in this model. 

LoanDefaultNnet.R - The neural network algorithm with two hidden layers is applied to a loan defualt dataset. The model aims to predict loan default based on other variables

FreddieGray.R - The counts and types of crimes in Baltiomre are observed before and after the death of Freddie Gray
